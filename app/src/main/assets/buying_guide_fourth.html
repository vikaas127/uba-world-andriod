<h3>Buying an off-plan?</h3>

<img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_buying_guide_fourth_one.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>
<br>

<p>When you buy a house or flat off-plan, it means that you buy the property before it is physically built. MIND-BLOWING right?? 'Seeing is believing' doesn't work under this narrative.</p>
<p>We are likely to see more of this happening, with government incentive schemes such as Help to Buy equity loans being offered solely on new-builds.</p>

<br><b>The Process</b>
<ul>
    <li>Once you have found a suitable development whether to live in or for investment purposes. Speak to a mortgage adviser about your circumstances.</li>
    <li>Place a reservation fee to reserve the home</li>
    <li>Choose a conveyancer</li>
</ul>

<br><b>'Flipping' property</b>
<p>'Flipping' happens when a buyer purchases a property off-plan and then attempts to sell it for a profit when the development is completed (or sometimes even before). This can be also called 'Reassignment'. Check our glossary for this word.</p>
<p>Investors planning to flip will target their developments carefully and buy when the first properties are released for sale.</p>
<p>Flipping is usually practised by cash buyers, as it can be hard to get a mortgage for this type of investment. If you're thinking of flipping, you'll first need to check with the developer and your mortgage lender (if you're not a cash buyer), and work out in advance what you'll do if you can't sell the property. It is advisable to take financial advice before pursuing this type of investment.</p>

<br><b>Reassignment from a Good Agency:</b>

<ul>
    <li>Usually not on a Help to Buy Scheme</li>
    <li>Can require a minimum deposit of 30%</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>So the offer has been agreed</li>
    <li>The agent collects reservation payment for the property. You need to now sign a reservation form and email it back to the agents with your ID. This will get the property off the market, so check on your own to make sure the property is off all portals! This releases the legal documentation to your lawyers.</li>
    <li>Your lawyer then receives all legal information that is available from the sellers lawyers to review. They will have a look through it all and report to you on their findings. The lawyers will then agree the legal documentation that will move the contract to you. You and the seller will then have to sign it!</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
    <li>The assignment (similar to an exchange of contracts) – You will then make the second payment to your lawyer who will then pay it to the seller’s lawyer. The assignment then becomes effective. The benefits of the contract become all YOURS!</li>
</ol>

<p>Your managing Agent can offer to do the handover and snagging process on your behalf or you could do it yourself if you are managing the property yourself or living in the property.</p>

<br><b>What is SNAGGING?</b>

<br>
<br><img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_buying_guide_fourth_four.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>It is the process used to identify defects and resolve them as quickly as possible. A good snagging company will be able to find any faults and be able to ensure the developer puts the fault right within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>If you are using an agent, it can either be done in two ways.</p>
<p>They can either conduct the snagging themselves if this is one of the services they can carry out efficiently or they can provide a reputable company who specialises in snagging to conduct a full report, which will be at an additional cost. Then it is the duty of the agent to pass on the report to developers and ensure that the work is done at the handover process.</p>
<p>Get it done before the final completion!</p>

<br>
<br><b>Pros of Buying an Off-plan</b>

<ul>
    <li>More energy efficient</li>
    <li>You are the first person to live in the property. Brand new home!</li>
    <li>You can often select fixtures and fittings to suit your taste</li>
    <li>New properties usually come with guarantees. There is the NHBC's 10 year warranty but there are other companies who provide warranty and insurance.</li>
    <li>Repair and redecoration costs should be minimal for the first few years</li>
    <li>Could get a discount of up to 5%</li>
    <li>Often a simpler buying process</li>
    <li>Your home value could go up between you reserving it and moving in</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br><b>Cons of Buying an Off-plan</b>
<ul>
    <li>Can be difficult to get a mortgage</li>
    <li>Dodgy developers - do your research and get to know your developers</li>
    <li>Leasehold restrictions - when buying a leasehold property there are often certain conditions attached. These can include consent for alterations to the property, sub-letting and owning pets. So please read carefully and ask questions if you do not understand.</li>
    <li>Delays in moving in</li>
    <li>You could lose your deposit if mortgage issues mean that you can not proceed with the property</li>
    <li>The developer may be able to sue you if you can not complete the purchase</li>
    <li>There is not 100% certainty on what the finished property will look like.</li>
</ul>
