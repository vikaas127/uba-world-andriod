<br>
<p><b>• Property Search</b> – Try to use a reputable agency if you want to go through an agent. Have an idea of what you are looking for.</p>

<br><b>With respect to Post Lockdown Guidelines:</b>

<p>To help prevent the spread of infection, we encourage people to do the majority of their property searching online; for example only physically viewing those properties which you believe you are most likely to want to move into.</p>
<p>By law you are required to pay tax at 20% on your rental income. You will need to apply for this if you normally live outside the UK.</p>

<br><b>• Ready to put forward an offer</b>

<p><b>• Instructing a Solicitor</b> - Choose a property solicitor with knowledge and experience of the market your property is located in and also the type of property you are buying for example if it is a shared ownership scheme. It is important to know what the fees are likely to be from the beginning to avoid an unexpectedly high bill at the end.</p>

<br><p><b>• Offer accepted</b> - The seller is responsible for drawing up a legal contract to transfer ownership.</p>

<br><p><b>• Conveyancing</b> – Conveyancing is the transfer of legal title of real property from one person to another. There are a number of legal documents and procedures that must be completed when buying a property. For the transaction to move as quickly as possible, you will need a reliable property solicitor or conveyance to take care of the legal and administrative details.</p>

<br><p><b>• Survey and Mortgage Offer</b> – A professional person that examines the condition of a land or building. This will confirm the value of the property and highlight any structural issues that need to be considered by the buyers mortgage lender. Completion of this survey will enable a formal mortgage offer to be put forward and signed off. It is important to conduct the survey before the exchange of contracts.</p>

<br><p><b>• Exchange of Contract</b> – an offer is not legally binding until this is done.</p>

<br><p><b>• Woop, Woop COMPLETION</b> - Once you exchange contracts and deal with any remaining monies the buyer has asked for:</p>

<img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_buying_guide_second_four.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<ul>
    <li>The money is transferred from the buyer to the seller.</li>
    <li>The legal documents needed to transfer ownership are handed over to the buyer.</li>
    <li>The seller moves out and leaves the property in the state agreed in the contract.</li>
    <li>The seller hands over the keys to the buyer.</li>
</ul>

<br><b> Please bear in mind Post Lockdown
    <br>Guidelines for Agents here:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Agents should do what they can to promote flexibility when arranging move dates, for example advising clients to ensure contracts have explicit terms to manage the timing risks presented by coronavirus.</li>
    <li>Agents should work with their clients and other agents to broker a new date to move where sales are due to complete and one of the parties falls ill with coronavirus or has to self-isolate.</li>
    <li>Agents should ensure that any keys are appropriately cleaned before handover.</li>
</ul>

<p>The property now belongs to the buyer.</p>

<p>Prospective purchasers may wish to visit a property again once they have agreed a sale, for example to measure up. Where this has been agreed to, the above advice on prioritising virtual visits, hygiene measures, maintaining social distancing at all times and mitigating contact where possible should be followed.</p>
