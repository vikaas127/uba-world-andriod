<br><b>Deposit</b>
<p>This is the amount you put towards the cost of the property when you buy your home.</p>

<br><b>Valuation fee</b>

<p>The mortgage lender will assess the value of the property to establish how much they are prepared to lend you.</p>
<p>The cost can vary depending on the property’s value.</p>
<p>Some lenders might not charge you for this, depending on the type of mortgage product you select.</p>

<br><b>Surveyor’s fee</b>
<p>Before you buy a property, it is best to get it checked by a surveyor.</p>
<p>This is vital so you understand if there are any problems before you buy.</p>
<p>Surveys range from a basic home condition survey costing around £250 to a full structural survey from £600 or more.</p>
<p>Paying for a good survey could save you money on repairs in the long run.</p>

<br><b>Legal fees</b>
<p>You’ll normally need a solicitor or licensed conveyor to carry out all the legal work when buying and selling your home.</p>
<p>Legal fees are typically £850-£1,500 including VAT at 20%.</p>

<br><b>Electronic transfer fee</b>
<p>Typically this costs £40-£50.</p>
<p>It covers the lenders cost of transferring the mortgage money from the lender to the solicitor.</p>

<br>
<br><b>Estate agent’s fee</b>
<p>This is only paid by the seller and not the buyer. It is negotiated when they put the property on the market. It is usually 1% to 3% of the sale price plus 20% VAT.</p>

<br><b>Leaseholders’ costs</b>
<p>If you buy a leasehold property, you’ll have to pay ground rent and service charges to the person who owns the freehold.</p>
<p>Service charges and admin fees differ between properties. The amount you pay changes each year.</p>

<br><b>What are Service Charges?</b>
<p>Service charges are fees that most leaseholders pay to cover their share of the cost of maintaining the building they live in.</p>
<p>Service charges usually cover the costs of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Repairs to shared areas and the outside of the building, such as roof, external pipes, drains</li>
    <li>Buildings insurance</li>
    <li>Freeholders’ administration or management charges</li>
</ul>

<p>They can also be used to pay for shared services such as a caretaker, cleaners and the maintenance of shared areas.</p>
<p>You usually have to pay a share of everything even if you don't use some of the services.</p>

<br><b>Payment of service charges:</b>
<p>Service charges can be paid annually or more frequently. Your lease sets out when you should pay yours.</p>
<p>You don't have to pay service charges until the freeholder sends you a:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request for payment</li>
    <li>Summary of your rights and obligations</li>
</ul>

<p>Your freeholder must send you a summary of the service charges if you write to them and ask for it.</p>
<p>You can then ask to inspect and take copies of the accounts, receipts and other relevant documents. The freeholder must allow this within one month of your request.</p>
<p>Your freeholder could be fined if they don’t send you a summary of the costs or they won't let you inspect the accounts.</p>

<br>
<br><b>Moving costs</b>
<p>Hiring a professional removal company to move your belongings to your new house.</p>

<br><b>With respect to Post Lockdown Guidelines:</b>
<p>We encourage you to contact removal firms as early as possible in advance of your move.</p>
<p>You and your household should also try and do as much of the packing yourself as possible. However, where this is not possible, you should speak to your removal firms in advance.</p>
<p>We ask that, where possible, you clean your belongings, with standard domestic cleaning products before they are handled by others, including removal firms.</p>

<img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_buying_guide_third_four.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>Whilst the removers are in your home, you should ensure any internal doors are open and seek to minimise your contact with the crew, maintaining a distance of at least 2 metres where possible.</p>
<p>All parties should wash their hands and avoid touching surfaces where possible to reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus.</p>
<p>You should not provide refreshments but you should ensure they have access to hand washing facilities, using separate towels or paper towels if possible, which should be washed or disposed of safely afterwards.</p>

<br>
<br><b>Home insurance</b>
<p>It falls into two categories; buildings and contents. Home insurance provides important cover for your buildings, contents and personal possessions against loss or damage.</p>
<p>Buildings insurance is usually a requirement when taking out a mortgage and usually required to be in place on exchange of contracts.</p>

<br><b>Utility bills and Council Tax</b>
<p>If you have moved into a bigger property, your energy bills and Council Tax may also be bigger, so these costs will need to be taken into account.</p>

<br><b>Other costs</b>
<p>You may choose to professionally clean your new property before moving in, and you may want to change the locks once you have moved in. If you are moving into a brand-new property you may also need to pay for connecting a telephone line. Consider refurbishing and decorating if you want to make your home have your own personal taste.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Moving home is often a time when people want to undertake work to improve their new home or prepare their old home for sale.

    <li>No work should be carried out by a person who has coronavirus symptoms, however mild.
    <li>Tradespeople should wash their hands on entering the property using separate towels of paper towels which need to be washed or disposed of safely after use.

<ul>
    <li>Tradespeople should seek to minimise contact with homeowners and remain 2 metres apart from householders at all times.</li>
    <li>Tradespeople should implement a buddy system and ensure that the same people work together where this is needed.</li>
    <li>Tradespeople should bring their own refreshments but you should ensure they have access to hand washing facilities, using separate towels or paper towels if possible, which should be washed or disposed of safely afterwards.</li>

<b>Tax</b>
<p>You may need to pay:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stamp Duty Land Tax when you buy a home in England</li>
    <li>Land Transaction Tax when you buy a home in Wales</li>
    <li>Capital Gains Tax when you sell a home</li>
</ul>

<br><b>Stamp Duty Land Tax</b>
<p>You usually pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you buy a property for more than £125,000. If it’s your first home in England or Northern Ireland, you don’t have to pay tax if the property is £300,000 or less. This is called a 'Stamp Duty Relief' for First-Time Buyers. The rate you pay depends on the purchase price of the property.</p>
<p>Wondering if you are a First-Time Buyer?</p>
<ul>
    <li>You'll need to be purchasing the property as your main and only residence</li>
    <li>Never owned a freehold</li>
    <li>Don't have a leasehold interest in a residential property in the UK or abroad.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br><b>When do you have to pay Stamp Duty?</b>
<p>You have 14 days to file a Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) return and pay any SDLT due. This has been reduced from 30 days since 1 March 2019.</p>
<p>This period starts from the effective date of the transaction, which is normally the date you completed the purchase of your home.</p>
<p>If you don’t submit a return and pay the tax within 30 days, HMRC might charge you penalties and interest.</p>

<br><b>How to pay Stamp Duty?</b>
<p>Usually your solicitor will deal with the Stamp Duty return and any payment due for you, although you can do it yourself.</p>
<p>Either way, you’re responsible for making sure it’s all submitted on time.</p>
<p>If the price of your new home is under £125,000, you must still submit a return (unless exempt) even though you won’t need to pay any Stamp Duty.</p>
