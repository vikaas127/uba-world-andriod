<h3>Responsibilities for Landlord:</h3>

<img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_land_lords_first_one.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<br><p><b>1. Gas Safety</b> - Landlords need to ensure that any gas boiler and other equipment’s are serviced ONCE A YEAR.</p>
<p>A contractor registered with Gas Safe must carry out this service.</p>

<br>
<p><b>2. Electrical safety</b> - New Electrical Safety Standards in the Private Rented Sector (England) Regulations 2020 comes into force 1st of July 2020. Landlords need to ensure the ‘fixed’ electrical installations in their rented properties are routinely inspected and tested. This will require a ‘Electrical Installation Condition Report’ (EICR) provided by a qualified and competent person.</p>

<img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_land_lords_first_two.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>This regulation will apply to all tenancies whereby a private tenant has a right to occupy a property as their only or main residence and pays rent. It also applies to HMOs in England, which means it replaces the electrical safety duties specified in the ‘The Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations 2006‘</p>

<ol>
    <li>Apply to all new tenancies in England from 1st July 2020</li>
    <li>Apply to all existing tenancies in England from 1st April 2021</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p><b>3. Fire Safety</b> - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoke-and-carbon-monoxide-alarms-explanatory-booklet-for-landlords">Fit and test smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms.</a></p>
<p>Follow fire safety regulations for property in a purpose-built block of flats or for houses and property adapted into flats.</p>

<br><img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_land_lords_first_four.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<br>
<br><b>4. Discrimination Legislation</b> - Gov states that it is unlawful to discriminate against anyone for any of the following reasons:

<ul>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Being or becoming a transsexual person</li>
    <li>Being married or in a civil partnership</li>
    <li>Being pregnant or on maternity leave disability</li>
    <li>Race including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin</li>
    <li>Religion, belief or lack of religion/belief sex</li>
    <li>Sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<br><b>These are called ‘protected characteristics’.</b>
<p>Discrimination does not necessarily mean unlawful discrimination.</p>

<br><b>Here are some other situations where ‘discrimination’ may be a good idea:</b>

<ul>
    <li>People who you believe will not look after the property properly.</li>
    <li>People who have numerous county court judgements registered against them.</li>
    <li>People whose former landlord gives a bad reference for them.</li>
    <li>People who you feel uneasy about – your subconscious may be warning you that this person is going to be a bad tenant.</li>
    <li>People who can not afford the rent.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Discrimination vs Unlawful discrimination</h5>

<p>In short, it’s all about your reason for refusal to rent. If your reason is connected to a protected characteristic – then you will be in the wrong.</p>
<p>Apart from this, you can choose who you want to live in your property.</p>

<br>
<br><b>5. Energy Performance Certificates</b> (EPC’s) needed whenever a property is:
<p>Rented, Sold or Built.</p>
<p>You must order an EPC for potential buyers and tenants before you market your property to sell or rent.</p>
<p>In Scotland, you must display the EPC somewhere in the property, eg in the meter cupboard or next to the boiler.</p>

<br><b>An EPC contains:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Information about a property’s energy use and typical energy costs.</li>
    <li>Recommendations about how to reduce energy use and save money.</li>
    <li>An EPC gives a property an energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient) and is valid for 10 years.</li>
</ul>

<br><b>Getting an EPC: </b>
<ul>
    <li>In England, Northern Ireland and Wales you can obtain one by checking out ‘epcregister’.</li>
    <li>In Scotland you can obtain one by checking out ‘Scottishepcregister’ .</li>
</ul>

<p>Look for an assessor or advisor.</p>

<br><b>Buildings that don’t need an EPC</b>
<p>These include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Places of worship</li>
    <li>Temporary buildings that will be used for less than 2 years</li>
    <li>Stand-alone buildings with total useful floor space of less than 50 square metres</li>
    <li>Industrial sites, workshops and non-residential agricultural buildings that don’t use a lot of energy</li>
    <li>Some buildings that are due to be demolished</li>
    <li>Holiday accommodation that’s rented out for less than 4 months a year or is let under a licence to occupy</li>
    <li>Listed buildings - you should get advice from your local authority conservation officer if the work would alter the building’s character</li>
    <li>Residential buildings intended to be used less than 4 months a year</li>
</ol>

<br><b>Other key responsibilities:</b>
<br>
<br><b>1. Duty to allow tenants to enjoy their home</b>

<br>
<br><img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_land_lords_first_five.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>Landlords must let tenants live in their home without unnecessary interference.</p>
<p>You should not let yourself into your tenants home without there permission.</p>
<p>You are responsible for most repairs in your home. This applies to private, council and housing association landlords.</p>

<br><img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_land_lords_first_six.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The structure and exterior of the building, including the walls, stairs and bannisters, roof, external doors and windows</li>
    <li>Sinks, baths, toilets, pipes and drains heating and hot water</li>
    <li>Fixing chimneys and ventilation if they fall into disrepair (although you'll have to keep them clear of blockages)</li>
    <li>Gas appliances and electrical wiring</li>
    <li>Common parts of a building, such as entrance halls, communal stairways and shared kitchens.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must put right any damage to internal decorations caused by repair problems they are responsible for or while repairs were carried out.</p>
<p>Also these should be stated in tenancy agreement. Bear in mind Landlords, you must do the repairs that the law says you are responsible for, even if your agreement says something different.</p>

<br>
<br><b>2. Health Hazards</b>
<p>You should make sure that your home is free from any hazards that could affect the health and safety of anyone in your household.</p>
<p>Hazards could include things like damp and mold, pests and vermin, fire risks, dangerous electric, faulty gas boiler.</p>

<br><b>3. Duty to protect your Tenants Deposit</b>
<p>Protect it in a approved government scheme.</p>

<br><b>4. Duty to check your tenants right to rent.</b>
<p>It's a criminal offence if you do not do right to rent immigration checks.</p>

<br><b>5. Serve Prescribed Information: the How to Rent Leaflet</b>
<p>In England, landlords have to give their tenants a leaflet called ‘How to Rent The Checklist for Renting in England.’ Give it to your tenants when they move in and then get a physical, signed receipt or an email to confirm that you have completed this duty.</p>
<p>Just like the deposit information, if you don’t give your tenants the How to Rent booklet, then it may impede your ability to serve a section 21 eviction.</p>
<p>If an AGENT manages the property then they should already be complying with the rules.</p>
