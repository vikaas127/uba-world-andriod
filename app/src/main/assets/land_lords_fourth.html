<br>

<br><b>1. Gas and Electrical Testing</b>
<p>Complying with these safety standards for all gas and electrical appliances requires you to pay for a qualified professional to provide this service.</p>

<br><b>2. Types of Landlord Insurance</b>
<ul>
    <li>Buildings insurance to cover the rebuilding or major repairs to a home</li>
    <li>Contents insurance to cover items on the inventory</li>
    <li>Liability insurance to cover issues such as personal injury claims by tenants</li>
    <li>Loss of rent insurance to cover any damage or building work, which makes your property unrentable for a period of time.</li>
</ul>

<br><b>3. Repairs and Maintenance</b>
<ul>
    <li>Landlords must repair and maintain basic utility systems – Gas, electric, water, fire and smoke alarms etc</li>
    <li>Landlords must repair and maintain the structure and exterior of the property, such as roof and guttering, exterior walls and foundations, windows and doors and interior walls, ceilings and floors.</li>
</ul>

<br><b> Post Lockdown Guidelines:</b>
<ul>
    <li>If there are any necessary repairs, gas and electrical safety checks that need to be carried out then they should be conducted in the period between a property being vacated and a new tenant moving in. If this is not possible and visits are needed to an occupied property, this should be done by appointment with measures put in place to ensure physical contact is minimised, for example with residents staying in another room during the visit.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br><b>4. Landlord Licensing</b>
<p>This act came into force in April 2006. Selective licensing is intended to tackle anti-social behaviour, deal with poor housing standards and assist in improving the overall management of rented accommodation.</p>
<p>The cost of the licence is £520 for 5 years.</p>
<p>There are guidance notes to help you complete the online form.</p>
<p>Find out if your property needs licensing by checking on your boroughs website.</p>

<br><b>HMO License</b>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Well first of, it stands for House in Multiple Occupations. You will need an HMO license when a residential property is occupied by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>3 or more people who are unrelated and living there as at least 2 separate households.</li>
    <li>The 3 or more people living there share a bathroom and/or kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you mean by 'Household'?</p>

<img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_land_lords_fourth_two.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>Mi casa es su casa !</p>
<p>So a household is either a single person or members of the same family who live together. Now a family can include people who are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Married couples or couples living together as married (including people in same-sex relationships)</li>
    <li>Relatives or half-relatives e.g. grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings, nieces, cousins</li>
    <li>Step-parents and step-children</li>
    <li>Foster parents and foster children</li>
</ul>

<p>Larger HMOs exist when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The HMO or any part of it comprises three storeys or more.</li>
    <li>Occupied by 5 or more people</li>
</ul>

<p>HOWEVER!!!</p>
<p>That definition has just changed as of 1st of October 2018, so a property being three storeys does not imply it is a HMO anymore. In fact, single storey flats or two storey maisonettes will need a mandatory licence if they are let to 5 or more people who form more than one household. Although there are exceptions for purpose built flats situated in a block of three or more self-contained flats.</p>

<br><b>Extra responsibilities of HMO landlords</b>
<p>Landlords of HMOs must make sure that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The property is not overcrowded</li>
    <li>Proper fire safety measures are in place, including working smoke alarms</li>
    <li>Annual gas safety checks are carried out efficiently</li>
    <li>Electrics are checked every 5 years</li>
    <li>Communal areas and shared facilities are clean and in good repair</li>
    <li>There are enough rubbish bins/bags</li>
    <li>There are enough cooking and bathroom facilities for the number living there</li>
</ul>

<p>HMOs do not need to be licensed if they are managed or owned by a housing association, a council, a health service or a police or fire authority.</p>
<p>Licences usually last for 5 years but some councils can grant them for shorter periods. Check with your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">Local council</a> to find out if you need a Licence.</p>

<br><b>Minimum bedroom size for HMOs</b>
<p>If you applied for a HMO licence on or after 1 October 2018 or has renewed it since, bedroom sizes must be at least:</p>
<ul>
    <li>6.51 square metres for an adult</li>
    <li>10.22 square metres for two adults</li>
    <li>4.64 square metres for a child under 10 years old</li>
</ul>

<p>Some councils may set higher standards for bedroom sizes.</p>
<p>If a room is used as bedroom and doesn’t meet the size requirement, the council may allow you up to 18 months to make the room larger or the tenant will have to be moved to a different bedroom. The council can prosecute or fine you, if a bedroom is smaller than standards allow.</p>

<br><b>What happens if you do not apply for a licence but you ACTUALLY need one?</b>

<br>
<br><img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_land_lords_fourth_three.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>Well...
<ul>
    <li>It is a criminal offence to not have your property licensed if it is an HMO. if you get convicted mind you the fines are unlimited if you don't comply.</li>
    <li>Local authorities also can enforce other range of options.</li>
    <li>Know that your tenant can not withhold the rent if you have not yet applied for the license.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you or your managing agent allows a HMO to be occupied by more people/households than it is licensed for. This will be seen as a criminal offence and the fines are unlimited. If the breach is serious or you continue the breach, then the licence may be entirely revoked. If the council revokes a licence it must take over the HMO management.</p>

<br><b>5. Storage</b>
<p>Consider where you will store your items if your potential tenants have their own furnishings and would prefer using it.</p>

<br><b>6. Tax</b>
<p>When you rent out property you may have to pay tax.</p>

<br><b>7. Letting Agent Charges</b>
<p>Funny enough the next topic is about Letting Agents.</p>
<p>There is a trade organisation which governs letting agents called the Association of Letting Agents (ARLA) and it may be worth checking whether a letting agent is a member of this organisation which at least has a code of practice for it’s members.</p>
<p>The letting fees differ depending on Agency. Bear in mind those agencies in London charge relatively higher fees.</p>
<p>Let-only fees can vary, some agents may charge 2 weeks rent, some 1 months rent and some between 4% - 7% plus vat.</p>
<p>Whilst Management can vary between 10-15% plus vat.</p>
<p>It is not essential to use an Agent to find a tenant. If you feel you can avoid those costs and do it yourself, why not?</p>

<br>
<br><b>Using a Letting Agency???</b>
<p>Let-Only (Introductory): Main duties are as follows</p>
<ul>
    <li>Giving a rental assessment (how much rent a landlord could charge)</li>
    <li>Market on property portals</li>
    <li>Conducting viewings with prospective tenants</li>
    <li>Tenant referencing</li>
    <li>Make sure that the tenant has contents insurance</li>
    <li>Provide a tenancy agreement</li>
    <li>Take the tenants first payment and set up any direct debits</li>
    <li>Inform the relevant utilities about the readings at check in</li>
</ul>

<br><b>Management:</b>
<p>A good management agent will provide the full range of management services for your properties. Sometimes the property owner will only hand over certain tasks to a management agency and choose to handle some aspects themselves, but if you choose, you can pass full responsibility to the agent.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising your property to potential tenants</li>
    <li>Sourcing suitable and reliable tenants for the property</li>
    <li>Accompanying potential tenants to view the property</li>
    <li>Obtaining references and conducting credit checks on potential tenants</li>
    <li>Providing you with information on the latest safety regulations</li>
    <li>Preparing the tenancy agreement</li>

    <li>Checking in the tenant and agreeing the inventory</li>
    <li>Collecting the rent from the tenant</li>
    <li>Transferring the rental income to your account and providing you with statements of account</li>
    <li>Managing and arranging any necessary repairs</li>
    <li>Inspecting the property periodically and feeding back any comments to you</li>
    <li>Providing tenants with notice at the end of the tenancy</li>
    <li>Re-letting the property as quickly as possible and minimising any 'down-time'</li>

</ul>

<br>
<br><b>1. Qualifications</b>
<p>Check to see if the management agent is a member of the Association of Rental Letting Agents. ARLA has recently introduced an award called the Technical Award in Residential Lettings and Property Management. Look out for this accreditation when selecting a property management agent. ARLA lists qualified management agents on their website, so it's a great place to start looking.</p>

<br><b>2. Word of Mouth</b>
<p>Check with friends or acquaintances that also employ a property management service to understand what their experience has been with their agent.</p>
<p>The majority of property letting agents will offer both letting and full management services, but talk to several and negotiate and understand their terms before deciding which to agent to instruct.</p>
<p>Make sure you know which services you are getting and what you're paying for, either as part of a package or as extras.</p>
<p>Ask about 'To Let' boards, newspaper adverts, websites, magazines and their own marketing ideas.</p>
