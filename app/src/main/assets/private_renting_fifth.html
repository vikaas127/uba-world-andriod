<br><b>Moving in</b>

<ol>
    <li>Agree an inventory (or check-in report) with your landlord and, as an extra safeguard, make sure that you take photos. This will make things easier if there is a dispute about the deposit at the end of the tenancy. If you are happy with the inventory, sign it and keep a copy.</li>
    <li>Take meter readings when you move in. This will help make sure you don’t pay for the previous tenant’s bills.</li>
    <li>Read your written Tenancy Agreements carefully! Know your rights and responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Make sure that you have the correct contact details for the landlord or agent, including a telephone number you can use in case of an emergency.</li>
    <li>Pay the rent on time. If you don’t, you could lose your home because you have broken your tenancy agreement.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
    <li>Look after the property. But get your landlord’s permission before attempting repairs or decorating.</li>
    <li>Be considerate to your neighbours.</li>
    <li>Do not take in a lodger or sub-let without checking whether you need permission from your landlord.</li>
    <li>Make sure you know how to operate the boiler and other appliances and know where the stopcock, fuse box and any meters are located. If you do not, ask your Landlord to show you or your Managing Agent.</li>
    <li>Regularly test your smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detector – at least once a month.</li>
</ol>

<br><b>How do I do that?</b>
<p>All smoke detectors and alarms have a test button that, when pushed, causes the alarm to sound. Also, most detectors have either a blinking or a solid light that glows to let you know that the alarm is getting power.</p>
<p>Once a month, get up on a chair or use a broom handle for extra reach and push the test button. If you don’t hear anything, then your battery is dead.</p>
<p>The button test ensures that the batteries are working. However, it doesn’t tell you whether the detector is operating properly. To find out, put two or three lighted matches together and then blow out the flame, holding the matches so that the smoke wafts up toward the unit.</p>

<ol start="11">
    <li>Report any need for repairs to your landlord. There will be a risk to your deposit if a minor repair turns into a major problem because you did not report it.</li>
</ol>


<br><b>What your Landlord should provide you with</b>
<br>
<br><b>1. A gas safety certificate.</b>
<ol>
    <li-text>The landlord must provide one at the start of the tenancy and within 28 days of each annual gas safety check, if there is a gas installation.</li-text>
</ol>

<br><b>2. Deposit paperwork.</b>
<ol>
    <li-text>If you have provided a deposit, the landlord must protect it in a government approved scheme within 30 days and provide you with prescribed information about it. Make sure you get the official information from your landlord, and that you understand how to get your money back at the end of the tenancy. Keep this information safe as you will need it later.</li-text>
</ol>

<br>
<br><b>3. The Energy Performance Certificate.</b>
<ol>
    <li-text>This will affect your energy bills and the landlord must provide one (except for Houses in Multiple Occupation). If your tenancy started or was renewed after 1 October 2015 your landlord cannot evict you with a Section 21 notice (no fault eviction) if they have not provided you with these documents. You can still be evicted with a Section 8 notice if you break the terms of your tenancy.</li-text>
</ol>

<br><b>4. A record of any electrical inspections.</b>
<ol>
    <li-text>All appliances must be safe and checks every 5 years are recommended.</li-text>
</ol>

<br><b>5. Evidence</b>
<ol>
    <li-text>that smoke alarms and any carbon monoxide alarms are in working order at the start of the tenancy. Tenants should then regularly check they are working as stated above.</li-text>
</ol>

<br><b>6. Serve Prescribed Information: the How to Rent Leaflet.</b>
<ol>
    <li-text>In England, your Landlords should provide with you the leaflet called 'How to Rent The Checklist for Renting in England. They can also send it to you electronically. You know saving paper!</li-text>
</ol>
