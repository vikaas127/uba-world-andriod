<br><b>AT THE VIEWING</b>
<br>

<p>Things to look out for and questions to ask either the Agent or the Landlord:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Average amount for bills? Of course it is dependent on what you use but having an average will give you a rough idea.</li>
    <li>Why did the previous tenant leave? You might not get an honest answer but it’s worth asking.</li>
    <li>Confirm whether the property is furnished or unfurnished. What items will go and will stay?</li>
    <li>How much do I have to earn annually to be able to rent this property?</li>
    <li>Make sure you do a thorough inspection of the house so that you can detail carefully your special conditions. Otherwise you could be taking on a property with serious leak issues or no furniture etc.</li>
    <li>Confirm that by placing a deposit, this ensures that the property is removed from all portals it is marketed on.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br><b>Post Lockdown Guidelines:</b>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>To help prevent the spread of infection, we encourage people to do the majority of their property searching online; for example only physically viewing those properties which you believe you are most likely to want to move into. Although its easier said than done but just as a precaution.</li>
    <li>All physical viewings should be limited to members of the same household and open house viewings should not take place.</li>
    <li>When physically viewing properties, where possible, you should avoid touching surfaces, wash your hands regularly, and bring your own hand sanitiser.</li>
    <li>The number of people on a viewing should be minimised to those from your household that absolutely have to be there. If you need to be accompanied by small children, you should try to keep them from touching surfaces and ensure they wash their hands regularly.</li>
    <li>If people are being shown around your current home, you should open all internal doors and ensure surfaces, such as door handles, are cleaned after each viewing with standard household cleaning products.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<ul>
    <li>As most people choose to, we recommend that you vacate your property whilst viewings are taking place in order to minimise your contact with those not in your household.</li>
    <li>Initial viewings should be done virtually wherever this is possible and property agents should help you to do this.</li>
    <li>Everyone involved in the moving process must follow social distancing to minimise the spread of the virus.</li>
</ul>

<br><h3>So you like the property, you want to proceed…</h3>

<p>If you want to reserve a property, a letting agent may ask you to pay a holding deposit while they check your references.</p>

<img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_private_renting_fourth_four.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<br>
<p>Paying a holding deposit means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are committed to renting the property</li>
    <li>The landlord is committed to renting the property to you, subject to checks</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't pay a holding deposit or sign anything if you are not sure that you want the property, so don’t be forced by any agent to do so. It is your decision!</p>

<br><b>Before you pay any money, ask the letting agent to confirm to you in writing:</b>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>How the holding deposit will be used</li>
    <li>If it will be returned to you in full (this should happen if the landlord decides not to rent the property to you)</li>
    <li>If it will be used towards your moving in monies.</li>
    <li>If any of their fees will be taken from it</li>
    <li>When some of it may not be refunded, for example, if you give inaccurate information about yourself (they can't legally keep all of it)</li>
    <li-text>After you pay a holding deposit, the landlord shouldn't ask you to pay a higher rent than you initially agreed. You have the right to change your mind and get all your holding deposit back if they do.</li-text>
</ul>
