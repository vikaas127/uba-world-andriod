<h3>Checklist when looking for your new home</h3>

<br><b>1. Deposit Protection</b>
<p>You must belong to an authorised scheme whether you are a Landlord or a Managing Agent holding a tenancy deposit.</p>
<p>There are two types of tenancy deposit scheme, a custodial tenancy deposit scheme and an insurance-based deposit scheme.</p>

<br><b>Custodial Scheme:</b>
<p>The custodial schemes are free of charge to use and whenever you wish to protect a deposit, an amount equivalent to the deposit is transferred to the scheme that will hold it for the duration of the tenancy. At the end of the tenancy the parties release it according to agreement or if the landlord and tenant are unable to agree, the scheme can provide free dispute resolution.</p>

<br><b>Insurance-Based Deposit Scheme:</b>
<p>An insurance-based deposit scheme is where a landlord pays a fee into the scheme, which will insure against the landlord unlawfully retaining the deposit at the end of the tenancy. An insurance-based deposit schemes also offers a disputes service.</p>
<p>Be aware that although this fee is designed to be absorbed into the landlord's costs, there is nothing to stop a landlord passing on the fee to the tenant.</p>
<p>So if you are using an agency this can be one of the costs you have to pay as part of the charges when following the process of taking a property.</p>

<br><b>The two schemes are:</b>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Tenancy Deposit Scheme</li>
    <li style="margin-top:8px;">My Deposits</li>
</ul>

<b>Zero Deposit Scheme</b>
<p>We welcome the Zero Deposit Scheme!!!</p>
<p>Finding it difficult to come up with the large deposit when renting?? The Zero Deposit Scheme could be an alternative for you! It is designed to cut the upfront cost of renting for tenants, whilst providing the same level of protection for landlords. Referencing, check-in and check-out procedures all remain the same, and if there is any damage to the property or unpaid rent, you will need to reimburse the landlord yourself. If you dispute the landlord's claim, you and the landlord will be asked for evidence which will be sent for expert evaluation by the dispute service (TDS).</p>

<br><b>How does it work?</b>
<p>So you can ask your Landlord or Agent if they will consider it.</p>
<p>Your lettings agent will put you in touch with us and we will send you an online quote. Once you have made a payment equivalent to one week’s rent and provided your Direct Debit details, copies of the paperwork will be sent to all parties.</p>

<br>
<br><b>2. Children, Smoking and Pets</b>
<p>Check if the contract has rules about them.</p>
<p>If you have a pet and you want to rent consider these things:</p>
<p>Many Landlords worry that pets will damage their property and are really not worth the hassle. Damaging furniture is one thing they worry about.</p>
<p>However legally, landlords are unable to include a ‘no pets’ clause in contracts, due to the Unfair Terms in Customer Contracts Regulations 1999. Therefore all pets must be pre-approved by the landlord, and acceptance is at the landlord’s discretion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be flexible</li>
    <li-text>Start your search in good time, due to the lack of pet-friendly homes.
        Look for pet-friendly features.</li-text>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li>Introduce your pet to the Landlord</li>
    <li-text>Be upfront about the fact you have a pet.</li-text>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li>Create a CV for your pet</li>
    <li-text>You can include general details such as the name, age, sex, breed, general behaviour and an image, as well as a reference from your previous landlord and your vet.</li-text>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li>Extra Security Deposit</li>
    <li-text>This will help cover any damages that do occur and it will also further incentivise the tenant to prevent them occurring in the first place.</li-text>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li>Include in the Tenancy Agreement</li>
    <li-text>Once your pet has been agreed to, your landlord should add a clause in the contract agreeing to the ownership of your pet and their occupation in the property, and confirming that this will not affect your rights.</li-text>
    <br>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>I know it sounds crazy, but people do do this! Don’t LEAVE your animal behind</li>
    <li-text>Funnily enough, if you are evicted and an animal is left behind in the property, it is the landlord’s responsibility to deal with it.</li-text>
</ul>

<p><br><b>3. Fixtures and fittings.</b> Check you are happy with them, as it is unlikely that you will be able to get them changed once you have moved in.</p>

<p><br><b>4. Smoke alarms</b> – and carbon monoxide detectors if you have solid fuel appliances. Check these are provided. If not, your landlord must install them. They could save your life.</p>

<p><br><b>5. Check that the property is safe to live in.</b> Check that the tenancy agreement excuses you from paying rent should the building become unfit to live in because of, for example, a fire or flood.</p>
