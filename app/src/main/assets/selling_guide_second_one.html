<br><b>Step 1: Accurate Valuation</b>
<br>
<p>You need to first find out how much your property is worth. You will need to sell at the best possible price in the shortest possible time. Speak with reputable local agencies in the area, browse on RightMove, Zoopla for comparables. Look at how long other properties have been on the market and most importantly make sure the PRICE is right for you or whether it is better to hold on to the property.</p>

<br><b>Step 2: Estate Agents, which one?</b>
<p>Choose an Agent with these qualities</p>
<ol>
    <li>Good Marketing Exposure</li>
    <li>Great customer service</li>
    <li>Open for longer hours to conduct viewings</li>
    <li>High street presence might seem very significant but sometimes agencies might not have it but it doesn’t mean they should be discredited.</li>
    <li>Professionally accredited</li>
</ol>

<br><b>Step 3: Instructing a Solicitor</b>
<p>Before marketing your property, it is worth doing some research when it comes to finding a solicitor. Finding a solicitor that is professional, efficient and has the expertise can be the determining factor for a successful sale.</p>

<br><b>Step 4: Marketing</b>
<br>
<br><img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_selling_guide_second_two.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>Firstly, it is a legal requirement that all properties in England and Wales are marketed with an Energy Performance Certifcate (EPC). This gives your property an energy efficiency rating.</p>
<p>If you are using an agent, they will do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inform you to have your property in a clean and good state, so that they are able to take professional pictures and floor plans.</li>
    <li>They will offer full exposure of property across a wide range of media.</li>
    <li>They should also be providing you with constant feedback on progress.</li>
    <li>Offer accompanied viewings, so that they can use their expertise to efficiently sell your property.</li>
</ul>

<br><b>Step 5: Receiving an offer</b>
<p>You will be notified of offers both verbally and in writing with any special conditions. Consider the amount you are being offered, the financial position of the buyers, their chain if they are selling another property, and your own timescales.</p>

<br><b>Step 6: Offer agreed</b>
<p>The agent will do the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare a memorandum of sale</li>
    <li>Write to all parties to confirm the agreed price</li>
    <li>Ask you to confirm your solicitor's details.</li>
        <li-text>Your solicitor will send out a draft contract to the buyer's solicitor who will then carry out preliminary enquiries. At this stage you will also be able to agree on dates for the survey on your property, exchange of contracts and proposed date for completion. Remember that at this stage, either party can still withdraw without penalty.</li-text>
</ol>

<br>
<br><b>Step 7: Exchange of Contracts</b>
<p>Exchange of contracts occurs when the following have been confirmed and agreed:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Preliminary enquiries following receipt of draft contract</li>
    <li>Evidence of a good title</li>
    <li>Specific issues highlighted in the Lease, if applicable</li>
    <li>Local search queries – They will perform searches of Land Registry and Local Authority information. They will be checking for planning history, and any potential developments around roads, drainage and mining near the property.</li>
    <li>Fixtures and fittings to be included in the sale</li>
    <li>The buyer's mortgage offer</li>
</ol>

<p>Once both parties have signed the contract the deposit (usually 10% of the purchase price) will be telegraphically transferred or paid in the form of a banker's draft by the buyer's solicitor to your solicitor. The completion date is then set by mutual agreement.</p>

<br><b>Step 8: Completion</b>
<br>
<br><img border="0" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_selling_guide_second_four.jpg" alt="nothing" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<p>Completion is when the residual monies (usually 90%) are transferred from the buyer's solicitor to your solicitor's account. Your solicitor will inform you when the money has cleared in your account and will inform the estate agent to release keys.</p>

<b>Congrats, your property is sold!</b>
